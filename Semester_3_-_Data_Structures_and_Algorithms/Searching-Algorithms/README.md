<h2 align = "left">Set A</h2>

1. Create a random array of n integers. Accept a value x from user and write a function to implement linear search algorithm to check whether the number is present in the array or not and output the position if the number is present.

2. Accept n sorted values in array from user. Accept a value x from user and write a function to implement binary search algorithm to check whether the number is present in sorted array or not and output the position if the number is present.

<h2 align = "left">Set B</h2>

1. Read the data from file'cities.txt' containing names of cities and their STD codes. Accept a name of the city from user and use linear search to check whether the name is present in the file and output the STD code, otherwise output "city not in the list".

2. Read the data from file ‘sortedcities.txt’ containing sorted names of cities and their STD codes. Accept a name of the city from user and use binary search to check whether the name is present in the file and output the STD code, otherwise output "city not in the list".
