1. Write a program to accept n numbers and display them using functions.
    > [View Code](Set-A/Q1.c)
2. Write a program to accept n numbers and display them in the reverse order using functions.
    > [View Code](Set-A/Q2.c)
3. Write a function which returns the number of occurrences of a specific element in an array. Use this function in main.<p>Example:
    - Input 1 5 2 1 6 3 8 2 9 15 1 30
    - Number : 1
    - Output: 1 occurs 3 times

4. Write a function for Search, which accepts an array of n elements and a key as parameters and returns the position of key in the array and -1 if the key is not found. Accept n numbers from the user, store them in an array. Accept the key to be searched and search it using this function. Display appropriate messages.

6. Write a function to sort n elements in the ascending order using Bubble sort. Use this function in main to sort n integers and display the sorted set.
    > [View Code](Set-A/Q6.c)
7. Write a function to merge two sorted arrays into a third array such that it is also sorted. Use this function in main.
